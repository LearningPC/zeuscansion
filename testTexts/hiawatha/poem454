He was telling them the story
Of Ojeeg the SummerMaker
How he made a hole in heaven
How he climbed up into heaven
And let out the summerweather
The perpetual pleasant Summer
How the Otter first essayed it
How the Beaver Lynx and Badger
Tried in turn the great achievement
From the summit of the mountain
Smote their fists against the heavens
Smote against the sky their foreheads
Cracked the sky but could not break it
How the Wolverine uprising
Made him ready for the encounter
Bent his knees down like a squirrel
Drew his arms back like a cricket
