From his pouch he drew his peacepipe
Very old and strangely fashioned
Made of red stone was the pipehead
And the stem a reed with feathers
Filled the pipe with bark of willow
Placed a burning coal upon it
Gave it to his guest the stranger
And began to speak in this wise
When I blow my breath about me
When I breathe upon the landscape
Motionless are all the rivers
Hard as stone becomes the water
