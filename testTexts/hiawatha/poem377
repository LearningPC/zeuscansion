Thus the fields shall be more fruitful
And the passing of your footsteps
Draw a magic circle round them
So that neither blight nor mildew
Neither burrowing worm nor insect
Shall pass oer the magic circle
Not the dragonfly Kwoneshe
Nor the spider Subbekashe
Nor the grasshopper Pahpukkeena
Nor the mighty caterpillar
Waymukkwana with the bearskin
King of all the caterpillars
