Then began the greatest battle
That the sun had ever looked on
That the warbirds ever witnessed
All a Summers day it lasted
From the sunrise to the sunset
For the shafts of Hiawatha
Harmless hit the shirt of wampum
Harmless fell the blows he dealt it
With his mittens Minjekahwun
Harmless fell the heavy warclub
It could dash the rocks asunder
But it could not break the meshes
Of that magic shirt of wampum
