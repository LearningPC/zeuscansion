On the morrow and the next day
When the sun through heaven descending
Like a red and burning cinder
From the hearth of the Great Spirit
Fell into the western waters
Came Mondamin for the trial
For the strife with Hiawatha
Came as silent as the dew comes
From the empty air appearing
Into empty air returning
Taking shape when earth it touches
But invisible to all men
In its coming and its going
