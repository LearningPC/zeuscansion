Without speaking without pausing
Kwasind leaped into the river
Plunged beneath the bubbling surface
Through the whirlpools chased the beaver
Followed him among the islands
Stayed so long beneath the water
That his terrified companions
Cried Alas goodby to Kwasind
We shall never more see Kwasind
But he reappeared triumphant
And upon his shining shoulders
Brought the beaver dead and dripping
Brought the King of all the Beavers
