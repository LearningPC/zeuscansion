And thus saying he departed
Peacefully slept Hiawatha
But he heard the Wawonaissa
Heard the whippoorwill complaining
Perched upon his lonely wigwam
Heard the rushing Sebowisha
Heard the rivulet rippling near him
Talking to the darksome forest
Heard the sighing of the branches
As they lifted and subsided
At the passing of the nightwind
Heard them as one hears in slumber
Faroff murmurs dreamy whispers
Peacefully slept Hiawatha
