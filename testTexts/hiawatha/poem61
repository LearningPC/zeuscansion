Poor deluded Shawondasee
T was no woman that you gazed at
T was no maiden that you sighed for
T was the prairie dandelion
That through all the dreamy Summer
You had gazed at with such longing
You had sighed for with such passion
And had puffed away forever
Blown into the air with sighing
Ah deluded Shawondasee
