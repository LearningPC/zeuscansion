Hard his breath came through his nostrils
Through his teeth he buzzed and muttered
Words of anger and resentment
Hot and humming like a hornet
I will slay this PauPukKeewis
Slay this mischiefmaker said he
Not so long and wide the world is
Not so rude and rough the way is
That my wrath shall not attain him
That my vengeance shall not reach him
