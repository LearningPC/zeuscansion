He was thinking as he sat there
Of the days when with such arrows
He had struck the deer and bison
On the Muskoday the meadow
Shot the wild goose flying southward
On the wing the clamorous Wawa
Thinking of the great warparties
How they came to buy his arrows
Could not fight without his arrows
Ah no more such noble warriors
Could be found on earth as they were
Now the men were all like women
Only used their tongues for weapons
