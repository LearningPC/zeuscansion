On the shore stood old Nokomis
On the shore stood Chibiabos
And the very strong man Kwasind
Waiting for the heros coming
Listening to his songs of triumph
And the people of the village
Welcomed him with songs and dances
Made a joyous feast and shouted
Honor be to Hiawatha
He has slain the great PearlFeather
Slain the mightiest of Magicians
Him who sent the fiery fever
Sent the white fog from the fenlands
Sent disease and death among us
