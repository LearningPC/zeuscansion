Skilled was he in sports and pastimes
In the merry dance of snowshoes
In the play of quoits and ballplay
Skilled was he in games of hazard
In all games of skill and hazard
Pugasaing the Bowl and Counters
Kuntassoo the Game of Plumstones
Though the warriors called him FaintHeart
Called him coward Shaugodaya
Idler gambler Yenadizze
Little heeded he their jesting
Little cared he for their insults
For the women and the maidens
Loved the handsome PauPukKeewis
