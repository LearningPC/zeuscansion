Saw the firefly Wahwahtaysee
Flitting through the dusk of evening
With the twinkle of its candle
Lighting up the brakes and bushes
And he sang the song of children
Sang the song Nokomis taught him
Wahwahtaysee little firefly
Little flitting whitefire insect
Little dancing whitefire creature
Light me with your little candle
Ere upon my bed I lay me
Ere in sleep I close my eyelids
