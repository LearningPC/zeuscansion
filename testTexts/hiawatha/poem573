All day long roved Hiawatha
In that melancholy forest
Through the shadow of whose thickets
In the pleasant days of Summer
Of that neer forgotten Summer
He had brought his young wife homeward
From the land of the Dacotahs
When the birds sang in the thickets
And the streamlets laughed and glistened
And the air was full of fragrance
And the lovely Laughing Water
Said with voice that did not tremble
I will follow you my husband
