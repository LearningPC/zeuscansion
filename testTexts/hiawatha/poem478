And he killed them as he lay there
Slaughtered them by tens and twenties
Threw their bodies down the headland
Threw them on the beach below him
Till at length Kayoshk the seagull
Perched upon a crag above them
Shouted It is PauPukKeewis
He is slaying us by hundreds
Send a message to our brother
Tidings send to Hiawatha
