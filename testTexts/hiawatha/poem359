After him he saw descending
All the birds with shining feathers
Fluttering falling wafted downward
Like the painted leaves of Autumn
And the lodge with poles of silver
With its roof like wings of beetles
Like the shining shards of beetles
By the winds of heaven uplifted
Slowly sank upon the island
Bringing back the good Osseo
Bringing Oweenee the faithful
