When I shake my hoary tresses
Said the old man darkly frowning
All the land with snow is covered
All the leaves from all the branches
Fall and fade and die and wither
For I breathe and lo they are not
From the waters and the marshes
Rise the wild goose and the heron
Fly away to distant regions
For I speak and lo they are not
And whereer my footsteps wander
All the wild beasts of the forest
Hide themselves in holes and caverns
And the earth becomes as flintstone
