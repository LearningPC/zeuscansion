Thus the wretched Shawondasee
Breathed into the air his sorrow
And the SouthWind oer the prairie
Wandered warm with sighs of passion
With the sighs of Shawondasee
Till the air seemed full of snowflakes
Full of thistledown the prairie
And the maid with hair like sunshine
Vanished from his sight forever
Never more did Shawondasee
See the maid with yellow tresses
