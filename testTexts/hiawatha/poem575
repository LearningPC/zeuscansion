Hark she said I hear a rushing
Hear a roaring and a rushing
Hear the Falls of Minnehaha
Calling to me from a distance
No my child said old Nokomis
T is the nightwind in the pinetrees
Look she said I see my father
Standing lonely at his doorway
Beckoning to me from his wigwam
In the land of the Dacotahs
No my child said old Nokomis
T is the smoke that waves and beckons
Ah said she the eyes of Pauguk
Glare upon me in the darkness
I can feel his icy fingers
Clasping mine amid the darkness
Hiawatha Hiawatha
