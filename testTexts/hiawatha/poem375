Once when all the maize was planted
Hiawatha wise and thoughtful
Spake and said to Minnehaha
To his wife the Laughing Water
You shall bless tonight the cornfields
Draw a magic circle round them
To protect them from destruction
Blast of mildew blight of insect
Wagemin the thief of cornfields
Paimosaid who steals the maizeear
