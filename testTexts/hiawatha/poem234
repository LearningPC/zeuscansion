Take your bow O Hiawatha
Take your arrows jasperheaded
Take your warclub Puggawaugun
And your mittens Minjekahwun
And your birchcanoe for sailing
And the oil of MisheNahma
So to smear its sides that swiftly
You may pass the black pitchwater
Slay this merciless magician
Save the people from the fever
That he breathes across the fenlands
And avenge my fathers murder
