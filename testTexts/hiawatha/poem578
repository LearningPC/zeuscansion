And he rushed into the wigwam
Saw the old Nokomis slowly
Rocking to and fro and moaning
Saw his lovely Minnehaha
Lying dead and cold before him
And his bursting heart within him
Uttered such a cry of anguish
That the forest moaned and shuddered
That the very stars in heaven
Shook and trembled with his anguish
