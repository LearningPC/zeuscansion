When the noiseless night descended
Broad and dark oer field and forest
When the mournful Wawonaissa
Sorrowing sang among the hemlocks
And the Spirit of Sleep Nepahwin
Shut the doors of all the wigwams
From her bed rose Laughing Water
Laid aside her garments wholly
And with darkness clothed and guarded
Unashamed and unaffrighted
Walked securely round the cornfields
Drew the sacred magic circle
Of her footprints round the cornfields
