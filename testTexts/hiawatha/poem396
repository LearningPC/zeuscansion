And wheneer a youth or maiden
Found a crooked ear in husking
Found a maizeear in the husking
Blighted mildewed or misshapen
Then they laughed and sang together
Crept and limped about the cornfields
Mimicked in their gait and gestures
Some old man bent almost double
Singing singly or together
Wagemin the thief of cornfields
Paimosaid who steals the maizeear
