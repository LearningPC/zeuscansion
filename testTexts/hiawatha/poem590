When I shake my flowing ringlets
Said the young man softly laughing
Showers of rain fall warm and welcome
Plants lift up their heads rejoicing
Back unto their lakes and marshes
Come the wild goose and the heron
Homeward shoots the arrowy swallow
Sing the bluebird and the robin
And whereer my footsteps wander
All the meadows wave with blossoms
All the woodlands ring with music
All the trees are dark with foliage
