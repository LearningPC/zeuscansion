On the shores of Gitche Gumee
On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo
By the shining BigSeaWater
Stood the lodge of PauPukKeewis
It was he who in his frenzy
Whirled these drifting sands together
On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo
When among the guests assembled
He so merrily and madly
Danced at Hiawathas wedding
Danced the Beggars Dance to please them
