With his right hand Hiawatha
Smote amain the hollow oaktree
Rent it into shreds and splinters
Left it lying there in fragments
But in vain for PauPukKeewis
Once again in human figure
Full in sight ran on before him
Sped away in gust and whirlwind
On the shores of Gitche Gumee
Westward by the BigSeaWater
Came unto the rocky headlands
To the Pictured Rocks of sandstone
Looking over lake and landscape
