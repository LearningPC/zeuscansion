Might not leave her in the darkness
Farewell said he Minnehaha
Farewell O my Laughing Water
All my heart is buried with you
All my thoughts go onward with you
Come not back again to labor
Come not back again to suffer
Where the Famine and the Fever
Wear the heart and waste the body
Soon my task will be completed
Soon your footsteps I shall follow
To the Islands of the Blessed
To the Kingdom of Ponemah
To the Land of the Hereafter
