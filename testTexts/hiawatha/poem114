Back retreated Mudjekeewis
Rushing westward oer the mountains
Stumbling westward down the mountains
Three whole days retreated fighting
Still pursued by Hiawatha
To the doorways of the WestWind
To the portals of the Sunset
To the earths remotest border
Where into the empty spaces
Sinks the sun as a flamingo
Drops into her nest at nightfall
In the melancholy marshes
