Once when Peboan the Winter
Roofed with ice the BigSeaWater
When the snowflakes whirling downward
Hissed among the withered oakleaves
Changed the pinetrees into wigwams
Covered all the earth with silence
Armed with arrows shod with snowshoes
Heeding not his brothers warning
Fearing not the Evil Spirits
Forth to hunt the deer with antlers
All alone went Chibiabos
