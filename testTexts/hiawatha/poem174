We must go back said the old man
Oer these logs we cannot clamber
Not a woodchuck could get through them
Not a squirrel clamber oer them
And straightway his pipe he lighted
And sat down to smoke and ponder
But before his pipe was finished
Lo the path was cleared before him
All the trunks had Kwasind lifted
To the right hand to the left hand
Shot the pinetrees swift as arrows
Hurled the cedars light as lances
