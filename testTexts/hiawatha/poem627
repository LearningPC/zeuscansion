Heavy with the heat and silence
Grew the afternoon of Summer
With a drowsy sound the forest
Whispered round the sultry wigwam
With a sound of sleep the water
Rippled on the beach below it
From the cornfields shrill and ceaseless
Sang the grasshopper Pahpukkeena
And the guests of Hiawatha
Weary with the heat of Summer
Slumbered in the sultry wigwam
