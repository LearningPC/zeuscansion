At the doorway of his wigwam
Sat the ancient Arrowmaker
In the land of the Dacotahs
Making arrowheads of jasper
Arrowheads of chalcedony
At his side in all her beauty
Sat the lovely Minnehaha
Sat his daughter Laughing Water
Plaiting mats of flags and rushes
Of the past the old mans thoughts were
And the maidens of the future
