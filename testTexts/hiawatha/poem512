But his soul his ghost his shadow
Still survived as PauPukKeewis
Took again the form and features
Of the handsome Yenadizze
And again went rushing onward
Followed fast by Hiawatha
Crying Not so wide the world is
Not so long and rough the way is
But my wrath shall overtake you
But my vengeance shall attain you
