From his eyes the tears were flowing
As from melting lakes the streamlets
And his body shrunk and dwindled
As the shouting sun ascended
Till into the air it faded
Till into the ground it vanished
And the young man saw before him
On the hearthstone of the wigwam
Where the fire had smoked and smouldered
Saw the earliest flower of Springtime
Saw the Beauty of the Springtime
Saw the Miskodeed in blossom
