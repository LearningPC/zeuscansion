Then the noble Hiawatha
Took his soul his ghost his shadow
Spake and said O PauPukKeewis
Never more in human figure
Shall you search for new adventures
Never more with jest and laughter
Dance the dust and leaves in whirlwinds
But above there in the heavens
You shall soar and sail in circles
I will change you to an eagle
To Keneu the great wareagle
Chief of all the fowls with feathers
Chief of Hiawathas chickens
