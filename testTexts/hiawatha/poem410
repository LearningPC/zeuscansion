And the Jossakeeds the Prophets
The Wabenos the Magicians
And the Medicinemen the Medas
Painted upon bark and deerskin
Figures for the songs they chanted
For each song a separate symbol
Figures mystical and awful
Figures strange and brightly colored
And each figure had its meaning
Each some magic song suggested
