Round about him spun the landscape
Sky and forest reeled together
And his strong heart leaped within him
As the sturgeon leaps and struggles
In a net to break its meshes
Like a ring of fire around him
Blazed and flared the red horizon
And a hundred suns seemed looking
At the combat of the wrestlers
