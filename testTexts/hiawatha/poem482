From the lowlands far beneath them
From the Muskoday the meadow
PauPukKeewis turning backward
Made a gesture of defiance
Made a gesture of derision
And aloud cried Hiawatha
From the summit of the mountains
Not so long and wide the world is
Not so rude and rough the way is
But my wrath shall overtake you
And my vengeance shall attain you
