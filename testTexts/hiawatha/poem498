On the lodges roof the hunters
Leaped and broke it all asunder
Streamed the sunshine through the crevice
Sprang the beavers through the doorway
Hid themselves in deeper water
In the channel of the streamlet
But the mighty PauPukKeewis
Could not pass beneath the doorway
He was puffed with pride and feeding
He was swollen like a bladder
