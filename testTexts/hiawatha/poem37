Hark you Bear you are a coward
And no Brave as you pretended
Else you would not cry and whimper
Like a miserable woman
Bear you know our tribes are hostile
Long have been at war together
Now you find that we are strongest
You go sneaking in the forest
You go hiding in the mountains
Had you conquered me in battle
Not a groan would I have uttered
But you Bear sit here and whimper
And disgrace your tribe by crying
Like a wretched Shaugodaya
Like a cowardly old woman
