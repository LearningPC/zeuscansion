On their faces gleamed the firelight
Painting them with streaks of crimson
In the eyes of old Nokomis
Glimmered like the watery moonlight
In the eyes of Laughing Water
Glistened like the sun in water
And behind them crouched their shadows
In the corners of the wigwam
And the smoke in wreaths above them
Climbed and crowded through the smokeflue
