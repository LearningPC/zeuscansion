Saw the moon rise from the water
Rippling rounding from the water
Saw the flecks and shadows on it
Whispered What is that Nokomis
And the good Nokomis answered
Once a warrior very angry
Seized his grandmother and threw her
Up into the sky at midnight
Right against the moon he threw her
T is her body that you see there
