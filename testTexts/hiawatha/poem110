Then up started Hiawatha
And with threatening look and gesture
Laid his hand upon the black rock
On the fatal Wawbeek laid it
With his mittens Minjekahwun
Rent the jutting crag asunder
Smote and crushed it into fragments
Hurled them madly at his father
The remorseful Mudjekeewis
For his heart was hot within him
Like a living coal his heart was
