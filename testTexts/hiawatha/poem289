Over wide and rushing rivers
In his arms he bore the maiden
Light he thought her as a feather
As the plume upon his headgear
Cleared the tangled pathway for her
Bent aside the swaying branches
Made at night a lodge of branches
And a bed with boughs of hemlock
And a fire before the doorway
With the dry cones of the pinetree
