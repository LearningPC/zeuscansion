There without stood Hiawatha
Found the doorways closed against him
With his mittens Minjekahwun
Smote great caverns in the sandstone
Cried aloud in tones of thunder
Open I am Hiawatha
But the Old Man of the Mountain
Opened not and made no answer
From the silent crags of sandstone
From the gloomy rock abysses
