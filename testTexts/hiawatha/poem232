And Nokomis the old woman
Pointing with her finger westward
Spake these words to Hiawatha
Yonder dwells the great PearlFeather
Megissogwon the Magician
Manito of Wealth and Wampum
Guarded by his fiery serpents
Guarded by the black pitchwater
You can see his fiery serpents
The Kenabeek the great serpents
Coiling playing in the water
You can see the black pitchwater
Stretching far away beyond them
To the purple clouds of sunset
