Then they shook their medicinepouches
Oer the head of Hiawatha
Danced their medicinedance around him
And upstarting wild and haggard
Like a man from dreams awakened
He was healed of all his madness
As the clouds are swept from heaven
Straightway from his brain departed
All his moody melancholy
As the ice is swept from rivers
Straightway from his heart departed
All his sorrow and affliction
