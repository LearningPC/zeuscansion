In a circle round the doorway
With their pipes they sat in silence
Waiting to behold the strangers
Waiting to receive their message
Till the BlackRobe chief the Paleface
From the wigwam came to greet them
Stammering in his speech a little
Speaking words yet unfamiliar
It is well they said O brother
That you come so far to see us
