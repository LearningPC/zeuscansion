He was dressed in shirt of doeskin
White and soft and fringed with ermine
All inwrought with beads of wampum
He was dressed in deerskin leggings
Fringed with hedgehog quills and ermine
And in moccasins of buckskin
Thick with quills and beads embroidered
On his head were plumes of swans down
On his heels were tails of foxes
In one hand a fan of feathers
And a pipe was in the other
