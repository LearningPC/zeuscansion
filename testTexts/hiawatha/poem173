Down a narrow pass they wandered
Where a brooklet led them onward
Where the trail of deer and bison
Marked the soft mud on the margin
Till they found all further passage
Shut against them barred securely
By the trunks of trees uprooted
Lying lengthwise lying crosswise
And forbidding further passage
