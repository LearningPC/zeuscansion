I have slain the MisheNahma
Slain the King of Fishes said he
Look the seagulls feed upon him
Yes my friends Kayoshk the seagulls
Drive them not away Nokomis
They have saved me from great peril
In the body of the sturgeon
Wait until their meal is ended
Till their craws are full with feasting
Till they homeward fly at sunset
To their nests among the marshes
Then bring all your pots and kettles
And make oil for us in Winter
