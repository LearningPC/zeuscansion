Then they summoned Chibiabos
From his grave beneath the waters
From the sands of Gitche Gumee
Summoned Hiawathas brother
And so mighty was the magic
Of that cry and invocation
That he heard it as he lay there
Underneath the BigSeaWater
From the sand he rose and listened
Heard the music and the singing
Came obedient to the summons
To the doorway of the wigwam
But to enter they forbade him
