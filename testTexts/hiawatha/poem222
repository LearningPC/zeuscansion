Then he heard a clang and flapping
As of many wings assembling
Heard a screaming and confusion
As of birds of prey contending
Saw a gleam of light above him
Shining through the ribs of Nahma
Saw the glittering eyes of seagulls
Of Kayoshk the seagulls peering
Gazing at him through the opening
Heard them saying to each other
T is our brother Hiawatha
