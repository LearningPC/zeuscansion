Four days is the spirits journey
To the land of ghosts and shadows
Four its lonely night encampments
Four times must their fires be lighted
Therefore when the dead are buried
Let a fire as night approaches
Four times on the grave be kindled
That the soul upon its journey
May not lack the cheerful firelight
May not grope about in darkness
