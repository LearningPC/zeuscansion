In those days said Hiawatha
Lo how all things fade and perish
From the memory of the old men
Pass away the great traditions
The achievements of the warriors
The adventures of the hunters
All the wisdom of the Medas
All the craft of the Wabenos
All the marvellous dreams and visions
Of the Jossakeeds the Prophets
