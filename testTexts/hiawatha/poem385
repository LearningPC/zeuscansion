Soon they came with caw and clamor
Rush of wings and cry of voices
To their work of devastation
Settling down upon the cornfields
Delving deep with beak and talon
For the body of Mondamin
And with all their craft and cunning
All their skill in wiles of warfare
They perceived no danger near them
Till their claws became entangled
Till they found themselves imprisoned
In the snares of Hiawatha
