I have given you lands to hunt in
I have given you streams to fish in
I have given you bear and bison
I have given you roe and reindeer
I have given you brant and beaver
Filled the marshes full of wildfowl
Filled the rivers full of fishes
Why then are you not contented
Why then will you hunt each other
