All the many sounds of nature
Borrowed sweetness from his singing
All the hearts of men were softened
By the pathos of his music
For he sang of peace and freedom
Sang of beauty love and longing
Sang of death and life undying
In the Islands of the Blessed
In the kingdom of Ponemah
In the land of the Hereafter
