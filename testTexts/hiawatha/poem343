Taste the food that stands before you
It is blessed and enchanted
It has magic virtues in it
It will change you to a spirit
All your bowls and all your kettles
Shall be wood and clay no longer
But the bowls be changed to wampum
And the kettles shall be silver
They shall shine like shells of scarlet
Like the fire shall gleam and glimmer
