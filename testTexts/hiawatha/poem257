Then he stripped the shirt of wampum
From the back of Megissogwon
As a trophy of the battle
As a signal of his conquest
On the shore he left the body
Half on land and half in water
In the sand his feet were buried
And his face was in the water
And above him wheeled and clamored
The Keneu the great wareagle
Sailing round in narrower circles
Hovering nearer nearer nearer
