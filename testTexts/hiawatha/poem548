When the evening meal was ready
And the deer had been divided
Both the pallid guests the strangers
Springing from among the shadows
Seized upon the choicest portions
Seized the white fat of the roebuck
Set apart for Laughing Water
For the wife of Hiawatha
Without asking without thanking
Eagerly devoured the morsels
Flitted back among the shadows
In the corner of the wigwam
