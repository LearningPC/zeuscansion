And the name of PauPukKeewis
Lingers still among the people
Lingers still among the singers
And among the storytellers
And in Winter when the snowflakes
Whirl in eddies round the lodges
When the wind in gusty tumult
Oer the smokeflue pipes and whistles
There they cry comes PauPukKeewis
He is dancing through the village
He is gathering in his harvest
