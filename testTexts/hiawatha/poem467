Then the smiling PauPukKeewis
Shook the bowl and threw the pieces
Lightly in the air he tossed them
And they fell about him scattered
Dark and bright the Ozawabeeks
Red and white the other pieces
And upright among the others
One Ininewug was standing
Even as crafty PauPukKeewis
Stood alone among the players
Saying Five tens mine the game is
