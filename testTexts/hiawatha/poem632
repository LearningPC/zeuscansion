I am going O my people
On a long and distant journey
Many moons and many winters
Will have come and will have vanished
Ere I come again to see you
But my guests I leave behind me
Listen to their words of wisdom
Listen to the truth they tell you
For the Master of Life has sent them
From the land of light and morning
