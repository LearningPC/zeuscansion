There the wrinkled old Nokomis
Nursed the little Hiawatha
Rocked him in his linden cradle
Bedded soft in moss and rushes
Safely bound with reindeer sinews
Stilled his fretful wail by saying
Hush the Naked Bear will hear thee
Lulled him into slumber singing
Ewayea my little owlet
Who is this that lights the wigwam
With his great eyes lights the wigwam
Ewayea my little owlet
