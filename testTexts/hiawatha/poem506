Up they rose with cry and clamor
With a whir and beat of pinions
Rose up from the reedy Islands
From the waterflags and lilies
And they said to PauPukKeewis
In your flying look not downward
Take good heed and look not downward
Lest some strange mischance should happen
Lest some great mishap befall you
