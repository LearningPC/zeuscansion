And victorious Hiawatha
Made the grave as he commanded
Stripped the garments from Mondamin
Stripped his tattered plumage from him
Laid him in the earth and made it
Soft and loose and light above him
And the heron the Shuhshuhgah
From the melancholy moorlands
Gave a cry of lamentation
Gave a cry of pain and anguish
