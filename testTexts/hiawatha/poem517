Then he raised his hands to heaven
Called imploring on the tempest
Called Waywassimo the lightning
And the thunder Annemeekee
And they came with night and darkness
Sweeping down the BigSeaWater
From the distant Thunder Mountains
And the trembling PauPukKeewis
Heard the footsteps of the thunder
Saw the red eyes of the lightning
Was afraid and crouched and trembled
