Stretched upon his back he lay there
Far below him splashed the waters
Plashed and washed the dreamy waters
Far above him swam the heavens
Swam the dizzy dreamy heavens
Round him hovered fluttered rustled
Hiawathas mountain chickens
Flockwise swept and wheeled about him
Almost brushed him with their pinions
