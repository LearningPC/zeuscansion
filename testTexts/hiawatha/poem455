Once he leaped said old Iagoo
Once he leaped and lo above him
Bent the sky as ice in rivers
When the waters rise beneath it
Twice he leaped and lo above him
Cracked the sky as ice in rivers
When the freshet is at highest
Thrice he leaped and lo above him
Broke the shattered sky asunder
And he disappeared within it
And Ojeeg the Fisher Weasel
With a bound went in behind him
