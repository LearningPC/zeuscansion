But Osseo turned not from her
Walked with slower step beside her
Took her hand as brown and withered
As an oakleaf is in Winter
Called her sweetheart Nenemoosha
Soothed her with soft words of kindness
Till they reached the lodge of feasting
Till they sat down in the wigwam
Sacred to the Star of Evening
To the tender Star of Woman
