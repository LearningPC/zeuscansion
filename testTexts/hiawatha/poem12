Ye who sometimes in your rambles
Through the green lanes of the country
Where the tangled barberrybushes
Hang their tufts of crimson berries
Over stone walls gray with mosses
Pause by some neglected graveyard
For a while to muse and ponder
On a halfeffaced inscription
Written with little skill of songcraft
Homely phrases but each letter
Full of hope and yet of heartbreak
Full of all the tender pathos
Of the Here and the Hereafter
Stay and read this rude inscription
Read this Song of Hiawatha
