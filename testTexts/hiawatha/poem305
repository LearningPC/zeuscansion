Barred with streaks of red and yellow
Streaks of blue and bright vermilion
Shone the face of PauPukKeewis
From his forehead fell his tresses
Smooth and parted like a womans
Shining bright with oil and plaited
Hung with braids of scented grasses
As among the guests assembled
To the sound of flutes and singing
To the sound of drums and voices
Rose the handsome PauPukKeewis
And began his mystic dances
