Lazy Kwasind said his mother
In my work you never help me
In the Summer you are roaming
Idly in the fields and forests
In the Winter you are cowering
Oer the firebrands in the wigwam
In the coldest days of Winter
I must break the ice for fishing
With my nets you never help me
At the door my nets are hanging
Dripping freezing with the water
Go and wring them Yenadizze
Go and dry them in the sunshine
