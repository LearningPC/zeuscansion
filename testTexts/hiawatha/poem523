If this hateful Kwasind said they
If this great outrageous fellow
Goes on thus a little longer
Tearing everything he touches
Rending everything to pieces
Filling all the world with wonder
What becomes of the PukWudjies
Who will care for the PukWudjies
He will tread us down like mushrooms
Drive us all into the water
Give our bodies to be eaten
By the wicked Neebanawbaigs
By the Spirits of the water
