But the ruler of the WestWind
Blew the fragments backward from him
With the breathing of his nostrils
With the tempest of his anger
Blew them back at his assailant
Seized the bulrush the Apukwa
Dragged it with its roots and fibres
From the margin of the meadow
From its ooze the giant bulrush
Long and loud laughed Hiawatha
