Buried was the bloody hatchet
Buried was the dreadful warclub
Buried were all warlike weapons
And the warcry was forgotten
There was peace among the nations
Unmolested roved the hunters
Built the birch canoe for sailing
Caught the fish in lake and river
Shot the deer and trapped the beaver
Unmolested worked the women
Made their sugar from the maple
Gathered wild rice in the meadows
Dressed the skins of deer and beaver
