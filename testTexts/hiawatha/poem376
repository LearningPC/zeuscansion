In the night when all is silence
In the night when all is darkness
When the Spirit of Sleep Nepahwin
Shuts the doors of all the wigwams
So that not an ear can hear you
So that not an eye can see you
Rise up from your bed in silence
Lay aside your garments wholly
Walk around the fields you planted
Round the borders of the cornfields
Covered by your tresses only
Robed with darkness as a garment
