Then from out his pouch of wolfskin
Forth he drew with solemn manner
All the game of Bowl and Counters
Pugasaing with thirteen pieces
White on one side were they painted
And vermilion on the other
Two Kenabeeks or great serpents
Two Ininewug or wedgemen
One great warclub Pugamaugun
And one slender fish the Keego
Four round pieces Ozawabeeks
And three Sheshebwug or ducklings
All were made of bone and painted
All except the Ozawabeeks
These were brass on one side burnished
And were black upon the other
