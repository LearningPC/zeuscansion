Then Waywassimo the lightning
Smote the doorways of the caverns
With his warclub smote the doorways
Smote the jutting crags of sandstone
And the thunder Annemeekee
Shouted down into the caverns
Saying Where is PauPukKeewis
And the crags fell and beneath them
Dead among the rocky ruins
Lay the cunning PauPukKeewis
Lay the handsome Yenadizze
Slain in his own human figure
