When the story was completed
When the wondrous tale was ended
Looking round upon his listeners
Solemnly Iagoo added
There are great men I have known such
Whom their people understand not
Whom they even make a jest of
Scoff and jeer at in derision
From the story of Osseo
Let us learn the fate of jesters
