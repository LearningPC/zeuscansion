Homeward then went Hiawatha
To the lodge of old Nokomis
And the seven days of his fasting
Were accomplished and completed
But the place was not forgotten
Where he wrestled with Mondamin
Nor forgotten nor neglected
Was the grave where lay Mondamin
Sleeping in the rain and sunshine
Where his scattered plumes and garments
Faded in the rain and sunshine
