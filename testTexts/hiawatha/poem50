And at night Kabibonokka
To the lodge came wild and wailing
Heaped the snow in drifts about it
Shouted down into the smokeflue
Shook the lodgepoles in his fury
Flapped the curtain of the doorway
Shingebis the diver feared not
Shingebis the diver cared not
Four great logs had he for firewood
One for each moon of the winter
And for food the fishes served him
By his blazing fire he sat there
Warm and merry eating laughing
Singing O Kabibonokka
You are but my fellowmortal
