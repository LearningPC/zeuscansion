Thus Osseo was transfigured
Thus restored to youth and beauty
But alas for good Osseo
And for Oweenee the faithful
Strangely too was she transfigured
Changed into a weak old woman
With a staff she tottered onward
Wasted wrinkled old and ugly
And the sisters and their husbands
Laughed until the echoing forest
Rang with their unseemly laughter
