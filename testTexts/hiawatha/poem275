She was thinking of a hunter
From another tribe and country
Young and tall and very handsome
Who one morning in the Springtime
Came to buy her fathers arrows
Sat and rested in the wigwam
Lingered long about the doorway
Looking back as he departed
She had heard her father praise him
Praise his courage and his wisdom
Would he come again for arrows
To the Falls of Minnehaha
On the mat her hands lay idle
And her eyes were very dreamy
