And still later when the Autumn
Changed the long green leaves to yellow
And the soft and juicy kernels
Grew like wampum hard and yellow
Then the ripened ears he gathered
Stripped the withered husks from off them
As he once had stripped the wrestler
Gave the first Feast of Mondamin
And made known unto the people
This new gift of the Great Spirit
