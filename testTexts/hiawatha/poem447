From the village of his childhood
From the homes of those who knew him
Passing silent through the forest
Like a smokewreath wafted sideways
Slowly vanished Chibiabos
Where he passed the branches moved not
Where he trod the grasses bent not
And the fallen leaves of last year
Made no sound beneath his footstep
