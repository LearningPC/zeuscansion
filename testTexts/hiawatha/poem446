Through a chink a coal they gave him
Through the door a burning firebrand
Ruler in the Land of Spirits
Ruler oer the dead they made him
Telling him a fire to kindle
For all those that died thereafter
Campfires for their night encampments
On their solitary journey
To the kingdom of Ponemah
To the land of the Hereafter
