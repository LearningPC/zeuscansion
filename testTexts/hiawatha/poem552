Never once had Hiawatha
By a word or look reproved them
Never once had old Nokomis
Made a gesture of impatience
Never once had Laughing Water
Shown resentment at the outrage
All had they endured in silence
That the rights of guest and stranger
That the virtue of freegiving
By a look might not be lessened
By a word might not be broken
