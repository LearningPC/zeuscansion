Bathe now in the stream before you
Wash the warpaint from your faces
Wash the bloodstains from your fingers
Bury your warclubs and your weapons
Break the red stone from this quarry
Mould and make it into PeacePipes
Take the reeds that grow beside you
Deck them with your brightest feathers
Smoke the calumet together
And as brothers live henceforward
