Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple
Who have faith in God and Nature
Who believe that in all ages
Every human heart is human
That in even savage bosoms
There are longings yearnings strivings
For the good they comprehend not
That the feeble hands and helpless
Groping blindly in the darkness
Touch Gods right hand in that darkness
And are lifted up and strengthened
Listen to this simple story
To this Song of Hiawatha
