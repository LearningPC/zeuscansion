And at night a fire was lighted
On her grave four times was kindled
For her soul upon its journey
To the Islands of the Blessed
From his doorway Hiawatha
Saw it burning in the forest
Lighting up the gloomy hemlocks
From his sleepless bed uprising
From the bed of Minnehaha
Stood and watched it at the doorway
That it might not be extinguished
