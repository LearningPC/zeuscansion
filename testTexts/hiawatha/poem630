I am going O Nokomis
On a long and distant journey
To the portals of the Sunset
To the regions of the homewind
Of the NorthwestWind Keewaydin
But these guests I leave behind me
In your watch and ward I leave them
See that never harm comes near them
See that never fear molests them
Never danger nor suspicion
Never want of food or shelter
In the lodge of Hiawatha
