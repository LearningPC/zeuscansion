Who shall say what thoughts and visions
Fill the fiery brains of young men
Who shall say what dreams of beauty
Filled the heart of Hiawatha
All he told to old Nokomis
When he reached the lodge at sunset
Was the meeting with his father
Was his fight with Mudjekeewis
Not a word he said of arrows
Not a word of Laughing Water
