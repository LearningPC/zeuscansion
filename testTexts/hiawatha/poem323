None could run so fast as he could
None could dive so deep as he could
None could swim so far as he could
None had made so many journeys
None had seen so many wonders
As this wonderful Iagoo
As this marvellous storyteller
Thus his name became a byword
And a jest among the people
And wheneer a boastful hunter
Praised his own address too highly
Or a warrior home returning
Talked too much of his achievements
All his hearers cried Iagoo
Heres Iagoo come among us
