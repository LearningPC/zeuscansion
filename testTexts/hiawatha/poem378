On the treetops near the cornfields
Sat the hungry crows and ravens
Kahgahgee the King of Ravens
With his band of black marauders
And they laughed at Hiawatha
Till the treetops shook with laughter
With their melancholy laughter
At the words of Hiawatha
Hear him said they hear the Wise Man
Hear the plots of Hiawatha
