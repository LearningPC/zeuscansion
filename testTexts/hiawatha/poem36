With the heavy blow bewildered
Rose the Great Bear of the mountains
But his knees beneath him trembled
And he whimpered like a woman
As he reeled and staggered forward
As he sat upon his haunches
And the mighty Mudjekeewis
Standing fearlessly before him
Taunted him in loud derision
Spake disdainfully in this wise
