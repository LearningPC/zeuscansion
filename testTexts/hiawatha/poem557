Cries of grief and lamentation
Reach us in the Blessed Islands
Cries of anguish from the living
Calling back their friends departed
Sadden us with useless sorrow
Therefore have we come to try you
No one knows us no one heeds us
We are but a burden to you
And we see that the departed
Have no place among the living
