Summer passed and Shawondasee
Breathed his sighs oer all the landscape
From the Southland sent his ardor
Wafted kisses warm and tender
And the maizefield grew and ripened
Till it stood in all the splendor
Of its garments green and yellow
Of its tassels and its plumage
And the maizeears full and shining
Gleamed from bursting sheaths of verdure
