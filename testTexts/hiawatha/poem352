At the door he hung the birdcage
And they entered in and gladly
Listened to Osseos father
Ruler of the Star of Evening
As he said O my Osseo
I have had compassion on you
Given you back your youth and beauty
Into birds of various plumage
Changed your sisters and their husbands
Changed them thus because they mocked you
In the figure of the old man
In that aspect sad and wrinkled
Could not see your heart of passion
Could not see your youth immortal
Only Oweenee the faithful
Saw your naked heart and loved you
