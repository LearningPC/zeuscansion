But she heeded not the warning
Heeded not those words of wisdom
And the WestWind came at evening
Walking lightly oer the prairie
Whispering to the leaves and blossoms
Bending low the flowers and grasses
Found the beautiful Wenonah
Lying there among the lilies
Wooed her with his words of sweetness
Wooed her with his soft caresses
Till she bore a son in sorrow
Bore a son of love and sorrow
