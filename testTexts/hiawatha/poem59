Till one morning looking northward
He beheld her yellow tresses
Changed and covered oer with whiteness
Covered as with whitest snowflakes
Ah my brother from the Northland
From the kingdom of Wabasso
From the land of the White Rabbit
You have stolen the maiden from me
You have laid your hand upon her
You have wooed and won my maiden
With your stories of the Northland
