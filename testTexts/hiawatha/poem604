Only Hiawatha laughed not
But he gravely spake and answered
To their jeering and their jesting
True is all Iagoo tells us
I have seen it in a vision
Seen the great canoe with pinions
Seen the people with white faces
Seen the coming of this bearded
People of the wooden vessel
From the regions of the morning
From the shining land of Wabun
