Oh the long and dreary Winter
Oh the cold and cruel Winter
Ever thicker thicker thicker
Froze the ice on lake and river
Ever deeper deeper deeper
Fell the snow oer all the landscape
Fell the covering snow and drifted
Through the forest round the village
Hardly from his buried wigwam
Could the hunter force a passage
With his mittens and his snowshoes
Vainly walked he through the forest
Sought for bird or beast and found none
Saw no track of deer or rabbit
In the snow beheld no footprints
In the ghastly gleaming forest
Fell and could not rise from weakness
Perished there from cold and hunger
