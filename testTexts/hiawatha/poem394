On the border of the forest
Underneath the fragrant pinetrees
Sat the old men and the warriors
Smoking in the pleasant shadow
In uninterrupted silence
Looked they at the gamesome labor
Of the young men and the women
Listened to their noisy talking
To their laughter and their singing
Heard them chattering like the magpies
Heard them laughing like the bluejays
Heard them singing like the robins
