Ever dear to Hiawatha
Was the memory of Mama
And in token of his friendship
As a mark of his remembrance
He adorned and decked his pipestem
With the crimson tuft of feathers
With the bloodred crest of Mama
But the wealth of Megissogwon
All the trophies of the battle
He divided with his people
Shared it equally among them
