Slowly from the ashes Kwasind
Rose but made no angry answer
From the lodge went forth in silence
Took the nets that hung together
Dripping freezing at the doorway
Like a wisp of straw he wrung them
Like a wisp of straw he broke them
Could not wring them without breaking
Such the strength was in his fingers
