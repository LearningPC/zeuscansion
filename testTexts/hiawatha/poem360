Then the birds again transfigured
Reassumed the shape of mortals
Took their shape but not their stature
They remained as Little People
Like the pygmies the PukWudjies
And on pleasant nights of Summer
When the Evening Star was shining
Hand in hand they danced together
On the islands craggy headlands
On the sandbeach low and level
