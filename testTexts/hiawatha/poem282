After many years of warfare
Many years of strife and bloodshed
There is peace between the Ojibways
And the tribe of the Dacotahs
Thus continued Hiawatha
And then added speaking slowly
That this peace may last forever
And our hands be clasped more closely
And our hearts be more united
Give me as my wife this maiden
Minnehaha Laughing Water
Loveliest of Dacotah women
