From the wigwam he departed
Leading with him Laughing Water
Hand in hand they went together
Through the woodland and the meadow
Left the old man standing lonely
At the doorway of his wigwam
Heard the Falls of Minnehaha
Calling to them from the distance
Crying to them from afar off
Fare thee well O Minnehaha
