Sailing on the wind to northward
Flying in great flocks like arrows
Like huge arrows shot through heaven
Passed the swan the Mahnahbezee
Speaking almost as a man speaks
And in long lines waving bending
Like a bowstring snapped asunder
Came the white goose Wawbewawa
And in pairs or singly flying
Mahng the loon with clangorous pinions
The blue heron the Shuhshuhgah
And the grouse the Mushkodasa
