Hot and red with smoke and gambling
Were the eyes of PauPukKeewis
As he came forth to the freshness
Of the pleasant Summer morning
All the birds were singing gayly
All the streamlets flowing swiftly
And the heart of PauPukKeewis
Sang with pleasure as the birds sing
Beat with triumph like the streamlets
As he wandered through the village
In the early gray of morning
With his fan of turkeyfeathers
With his plumes and tufts of swans down
Till he reached the farthest wigwam
Reached the lodge of Hiawatha
