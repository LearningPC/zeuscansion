Homeward weeping went Nokomis
Sorrowing for her Hiawatha
Fearing lest his strength should fail him
Lest his fasting should be fatal
He meanwhile sat weary waiting
For the coming of Mondamin
Till the shadows pointing eastward
Lengthened over field and forest
Till the sun dropped from the heaven
Floating on the waters westward
As a red leaf in the Autumn
Falls and floats upon the water
Falls and sinks into its bosom
