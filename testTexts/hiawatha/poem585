All the coals were white with ashes
And the fire was slowly dying
As a young man walking lightly
At the open doorway entered
Red with blood of youth his cheeks were
Soft his eyes as stars in Springtime
Bound his forehead was with grasses
Bound and plumed with scented grasses
On his lips a smile of beauty
Filling all the lodge with sunshine
In his hand a bunch of blossoms
Filling all the lodge with sweetness
