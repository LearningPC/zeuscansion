Straightway from the Shining Wigwam
Came the mighty Megissogwon
Tall of stature broad of shoulder
Dark and terrible in aspect
Clad from head to foot in wampum
Armed with all his warlike weapons
Painted like the sky of morning
Streaked with crimson blue and yellow
Crested with great eaglefeathers
Streaming upward streaming outward
