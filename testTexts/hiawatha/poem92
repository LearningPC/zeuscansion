He had mittens Minjekahwun
Magic mittens made of deerskin
When upon his hands he wore them
He could smite the rocks asunder
He could grind them into powder
He had moccasins enchanted
Magic moccasins of deerskin
When he bound them round his ankles
When upon his feet he tied them
At each stride a mile he measured
