Ay why do the living said they
Lay such heavy burdens on us
Better were it to go naked
Better were it to go fasting
Than to bear such heavy burdens
On our long and weary journey
Forth then issued Hiawatha
Wandered eastward wandered westward
Teaching men the use of simples
And the antidotes for poisons
And the cure of all diseases
Thus was first made known to mortals
All the mystery of Medamin
All the sacred art of healing
