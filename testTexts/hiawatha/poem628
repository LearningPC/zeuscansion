Slowly oer the simmering landscape
Fell the evenings dusk and coolness
And the long and level sunbeams
Shot their spears into the forest
Breaking through its shields of shadow
Rushed into each secret ambush
Searched each thicket dingle hollow
Still the guests of Hiawatha
Slumbered in the silent wigwam
