Then Osseo gazed around him
And he saw the nine fair sisters
All the sisters and their husbands
Changed to birds of various plumage
Some were jays and some were magpies
Others thrushes others blackbirds
And they hopped and sang and twittered
Perked and fluttered all their feathers
Strutted in their shining plumage
And their tails like fans unfolded
