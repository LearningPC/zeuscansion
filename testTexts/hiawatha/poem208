Take my bait cried Hiawatha
Dawn into the depths beneath him
Take my bait O Sturgeon Nahma
Come up from below the water
Let us see which is the stronger
And he dropped his line of cedar
Through the clear transparent water
Waited vainly for an answer
Long sat waiting for an answer
And repeating loud and louder
Take my bait O King of Fishes
