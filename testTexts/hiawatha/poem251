Till at sunset Hiawatha
Leaning on his bow of ashtree
Wounded weary and desponding
With his mighty warclub broken
With his mittens torn and tattered
And three useless arrows only
Paused to rest beneath a pinetree
From whose branches trailed the mosses
And whose trunk was coated over
With the Deadmans Moccasinleather
With the fungus white and yellow
