By the shores of Gitche Gumee
By the shining BigSeaWater
Stood the wigwam of Nokomis
Daughter of the Moon Nokomis
Dark behind it rose the forest
Rose the black and gloomy pinetrees
Rose the firs with cones upon them
Bright before it beat the water
Beat the clear and sunny water
Beat the shining BigSeaWater
