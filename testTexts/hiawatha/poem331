Once in days no more remembered
Ages nearer the beginning
When the heavens were closer to us
And the Gods were more familiar
In the Northland lived a hunter
With ten young and comely daughters
Tall and lithe as wands of willow
Only Oweenee the youngest
She the wilful and the wayward
She the silent dreamy maiden
Was the fairest of the sisters
