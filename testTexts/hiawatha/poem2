I should answer I should tell you
From the forests and the prairies
From the great lakes of the Northland
From the land of the Ojibways
From the land of the Dacotahs
From the mountains moors and fenlands
Where the heron the Shuhshuhgah
Feeds among the reeds and rushes
I repeat them as I heard them
From the lips of Nawadaha
The musician the sweet singer
