Forth went Shingebis the diver
Wrestled all night with the NorthWind
Wrestled naked on the moorlands
With the fierce Kabibonokka
Till his panting breath grew fainter
Till his frozen grasp grew feebler
Till he reeled and staggered backward
And retreated baffled beaten
To the kingdom of Wabasso
To the land of the White Rabbit
Hearing still the gusty laughter
Hearing Shingebis the diver
Singing O Kabibonokka
You are but my fellowmortal
