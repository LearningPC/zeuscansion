From his lodge went Hiawatha
Dressed for travel armed for hunting
Dressed in deerskin shirt and leggings
Richly wrought with quills and wampum
On his head his eaglefeathers
Round his waist his belt of wampum
In his hand his bow of ashwood
Strung with sinews of the reindeer
In his quiver oaken arrows
Tipped with jasper winged with feathers
With his mittens Minjekahwun
With his moccasins enchanted
