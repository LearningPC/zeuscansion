And her lovers the rejected
Handsome men with belts of wampum
Handsome men with paint and feathers
Pointed at her in derision
Followed her with jest and laughter
But she said I care not for you
Care not for your belts of wampum
Care not for your paint and feathers
Care not for your jests and laughter
I am happy with Osseo
