Then the grateful Hiawatha
Called the Mama the woodpecker
From his perch among the branches
Of the melancholy pinetree
And in honor of his service
Stained with blood the tuft of feathers
On the little head of Mama
Even to this day he wears it
Wears the tuft of crimson feathers
As a symbol of his service
