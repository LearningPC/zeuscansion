Then upon the ground the warriors
Threw their cloaks and shirts of deerskin
Threw their weapons and their wargear
Leaped into the rushing river
Washed the warpaint from their faces
Clear above them flowed the water
Clear and limpid from the footprints
Of the Master of Life descending
Dark below them flowed the water
Soiled and stained with streaks of crimson
As if blood were mingled with it
