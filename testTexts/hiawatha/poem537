Never stoops the soaring vulture
On his quarry in the desert
On the sick or wounded bison
But another vulture watching
From his high aerial lookout
Sees the downward plunge and follows
And a third pursues the second
Coming from the invisible ether
First a speck and then a vulture
Till the air is dark with pinions
