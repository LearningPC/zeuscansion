And so near he came so near him
That his hand was stretched to seize him
His right hand to seize and hold him
When the cunning PauPukKeewis
Whirled and spun about in circles
Fanned the air into a whirlwind
Danced the dust and leaves about him
And amid the whirling eddies
Sprang into a hollow oaktree
Changed himself into a serpent
Gliding out through root and rubbish
