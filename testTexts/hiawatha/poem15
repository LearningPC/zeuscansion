From the red stone of the quarry
With his hand he broke a fragment
Moulded it into a pipehead
Shaped and fashioned it with figures
From the margin of the river
Took a long reed for a pipestem
With its dark green leaves upon it
Filled the pipe with bark of willow
With the bark of the red willow
Breathed upon the neighboring forest
Made its great boughs chafe together
Till in flame they burst and kindled
And erect upon the mountains
Gitche Manito the mighty
Smoked the calumet the PeacePipe
As a signal to the nations
