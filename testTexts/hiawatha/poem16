And the smoke rose slowly slowly
Through the tranquil air of morning
First a single line of darkness
Then a denser bluer vapor
Then a snowwhite cloud unfolding
Like the treetops of the forest
Ever rising rising rising
Till it touched the top of heaven
Till it broke against the heaven
And rolled outward all around it
