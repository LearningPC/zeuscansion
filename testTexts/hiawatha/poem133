Standing at the open doorway
Long he looked at Hiawatha
Looked with pity and compassion
On his wasted form and features
And in accents like the sighing
Of the SouthWind in the treetops
Said he O my Hiawatha
All your prayers are heard in heaven
For you pray not like the others
Not for greater skill in hunting
Not for greater craft in fishing
Not for triumph in the battle
Nor renown among the warriors
But for profit of the people
For advantage of the nations
