Day by day he gazed upon her
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day his heart within him
Grew more hot with love and longing
For the maid with yellow tresses
But he was too fat and lazy
To bestir himself and woo her
Yes too indolent and easy
To pursue her and persuade her
So he only gazed upon her
Only sat and sighed with passion
For the maiden of the prairie
