Westward thus fared Hiawatha
Toward the realm of Megissogwon
Toward the land of the PearlFeather
Till the level moon stared at him
In his face stared pale and haggard
Till the sun was hot behind him
Till it burned upon his shoulders
And before him on the upland
He could see the Shining Wigwam
Of the Manito of Wampum
Of the mightiest of Magicians
