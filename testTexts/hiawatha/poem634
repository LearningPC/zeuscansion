And the evening sun descending
Set the clouds on fire with redness
Burned the broad sky like a prairie
Left upon the level water
One long track and trail of splendor
Down whose stream as down a river
Westward westward Hiawatha
Sailed into the fiery sunset
Sailed into the purple vapors
Sailed into the dusk of evening
