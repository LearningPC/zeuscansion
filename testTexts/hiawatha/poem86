Hidden in the alderbushes
There he waited till the deer came
Till he saw two antlers lifted
Saw two eyes look from the thicket
Saw two nostrils point to windward
And a deer came down the pathway
Flecked with leafy light and shadow
And his heart within him fluttered
Trembled like the leaves above him
Like the birchleaf palpitated
As the deer came down the pathway
