Then the curtain of the doorway
From without was slowly lifted
Brighter glowed the fire a moment
And a moment swerved the smokewreath
As two women entered softly
Passed the doorway uninvited
Without word of salutation
Without sign of recognition
Sat down in the farthest corner
Crouching low among the shadows
