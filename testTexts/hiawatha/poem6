In the vale of Tawasentha
In the green and silent valley
By the pleasant watercourses
Dwelt the singer Nawadaha
Round about the Indian village
Spread the meadows and the cornfields
And beyond them stood the forest
Stood the groves of singing pinetrees
Green in Summer white in Winter
Ever sighing ever singing
