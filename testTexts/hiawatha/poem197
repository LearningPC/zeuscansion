Thus the Birch Canoe was builded
In the valley by the river
In the bosom of the forest
And the forests life was in it
All its mystery and its magic
All the lightness of the birchtree
All the toughness of the cedar
All the larchs supple sinews
And it floated on the river
Like a yellow leaf in Autumn
Like a yellow waterlily
