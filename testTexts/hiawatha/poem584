In his lodge beside a river
Close beside a frozen river
Sat an old man sad and lonely
White his hair was as a snowdrift
Dull and low his fire was burning
And the old man shook and trembled
Folded in his Waubewyon
In his tattered whiteskinwrapper
Hearing nothing but the tempest
As it roared along the forest
Seeing nothing but the snowstorm
As it whirled and hissed and drifted
