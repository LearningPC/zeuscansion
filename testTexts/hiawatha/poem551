And whenever Hiawatha
Came from fishing or from hunting
When the evening meal was ready
And the food had been divided
Gliding from their darksome corner
Came the pallid guests the strangers
Seized upon the choicest portions
Set aside for Laughing Water
And without rebuke or question
Flitted back among the shadows
