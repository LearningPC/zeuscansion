On their pathway through the woodlands
Lay an oak by storms uprooted
Lay the great trunk of an oaktree
Buried half in leaves and mosses
Mouldering crumbling huge and hollow
And Osseo when he saw it
Gave a shout a cry of anguish
Leaped into its yawning cavern
At one end went in an old man
Wasted wrinkled old and ugly
From the other came a young man
Tall and straight and strong and handsome
