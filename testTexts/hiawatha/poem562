When they ceased a sudden darkness
Fell and filled the silent wigwam
Hiawatha heard a rustle
As of garments trailing by him
Heard the curtain of the doorway
Lifted by a hand he saw not
Felt the cold breath of the night air
For a moment saw the starlight
But he saw the ghosts no longer
Saw no more the wandering spirits
From the kingdom of Ponemah
From the land of the Hereafter
