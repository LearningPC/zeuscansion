There among the ferns and mosses
There among the prairie lilies
On the Muskoday the meadow
In the moonlight and the starlight
Fair Nokomis bore a daughter
And she called her name Wenonah
As the firstborn of her daughters
And the daughter of Nokomis
Grew up like the prairie lilies
Grew a tall and slender maiden
With the beauty of the moonlight
With the beauty of the starlight
