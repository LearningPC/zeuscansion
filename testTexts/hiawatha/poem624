Then the BlackRobe chief the Prophet
Told his message to the people
Told the purport of his mission
Told them of the Virgin Mary
And her blessed Son the Saviour
How in distant lands and ages
He had lived on earth as we do
How he fasted prayed and labored
How the Jews the tribe accursed
Mocked him scourged him crucified him
How he rose from where they laid him
Walked again with his disciples
And ascended into heaven
