Gitche Manito the Mighty
The Great Spirit the Creator
Sends them hither on his errand
Sends them to us with his message
Wheresoeer they move before them
Swarms the stinging fly the Ahmo
Swarms the bee the honeymaker
Wheresoeer they tread beneath them
Springs a flower unknown among us
Springs the Whitemans Foot in blossom
