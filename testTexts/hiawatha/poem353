In the lodge that glimmers yonder
In the little star that twinkles
Through the vapors on the left hand
Lives the envious Evil Spirit
The Wabeno the magician
Who transformed you to an old man
Take heed lest his beams fall on you
For the rays he darts around him
Are the power of his enchantment
Are the arrows that he uses
