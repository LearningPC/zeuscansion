And in silence all the warriors
Broke the red stone of the quarry
Smoothed and formed it into PeacePipes
Broke the long reeds by the river
Decked them with their brightest feathers
And departed each one homeward
While the Master of Life ascending
Through the opening of cloudcurtains
Through the doorways of the heaven
Vanished from before their faces
In the smoke that rolled around him
The Pukwana of the PeacePipe
