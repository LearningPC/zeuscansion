T is enough then said Mondamin
Smiling upon Hiawatha
But tomorrow when the sun sets
I will come again to try you
And he vanished and was seen not
Whether sinking as the rain sinks
Whether rising as the mists rise
Hiawatha saw not knew not
Only saw that he had vanished
Leaving him alone and fainting
With the misty lake below him
And the reeling stars above him
