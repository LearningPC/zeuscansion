From his place of ambush came he
Striding terrible among them
And so awful was his aspect
That the bravest quailed with terror
Without mercy he destroyed them
Right and left by tens and twenties
And their wretched lifeless bodies
Hung aloft on poles for scarecrows
Round the consecrated cornfields
As a signal of his vengeance
As a warning to marauders
