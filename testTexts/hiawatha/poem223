And he shouted from below them
Cried exulting from the caverns
O ye seagulls O my brothers
I have slain the sturgeon Nahma
Make the rifts a little larger
With your claws the openings widen
Set me free from this dark prison
And henceforward and forever
Men shall speak of your achievements
Calling you Kayoshk the seagulls
Yes Kayoshk the Noble Scratchers
