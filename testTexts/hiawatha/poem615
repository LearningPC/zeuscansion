It was neither goose nor diver
Neither pelican nor heron
Oer the water floating flying
Through the shining mist of morning
But a birch canoe with paddles
Rising sinking on the water
Dripping flashing in the sunshine
And within it came a people
From the distant land of Wabun
From the farthest realms of morning
Came the BlackRobe chief the Prophet
He the Priest of Prayer the Paleface
With his guides and his companions
