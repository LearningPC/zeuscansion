He it was who slew my father
By his wicked wiles and cunning
When he from the moon descended
When he came on earth to seek me
He the mightiest of Magicians
Sends the fever from the marshes
Sends the pestilential vapors
Sends the poisonous exhalations
Sends the white fog from the fenlands
Sends disease and death among us
