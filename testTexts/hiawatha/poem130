On the third day of his fasting
By the lake he sat and pondered
By the still transparent water
Saw the sturgeon Nahma leaping
Scattering drops like beads of wampum
Saw the yellow perch the Sahwa
Like a sunbeam in the water
Saw the pike the Maskenozha
And the herring Okahahwis
And the Shawgashee the crawfish
Master of Life he cried desponding
Must our lives depend on these things
