On the dam stood PauPukKeewis
Oer his ankles flowed the streamlet
Spouted through the chinks below him
Dashed upon the stones beneath him
Spread serene and calm before him
And the sunshine and the shadows
Fell in flecks and gleams upon him
Fell in little shining patches
Through the waving rustling branches
