All the air was white with moonlight
All the water black with shadow
And around him the Suggema
The mosquito sang his warsong
And the fireflies Wahwahtaysee
Waved their torches to mislead him
And the bullfrog the Dahinda
Thrust his head into the moonlight
Fixed his yellow eyes upon him
Sobbed and sank beneath the surface
And anon a thousand whistles
Answered over all the fenlands
And the heron the Shuhshuhgah
Far off on the reedy margin
Heralded the heros coming
