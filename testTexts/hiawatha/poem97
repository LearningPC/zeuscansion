But the fearless Hiawatha
Heeded not her womans warning
Forth he strode into the forest
At each stride a mile he measured
Lurid seemed the sky above him
Lurid seemed the earth beneath him
Hot and close the air around him
Filled with smoke and fiery vapors
As of burning woods and prairies
For his heart was hot within him
Like a living coal his heart was
