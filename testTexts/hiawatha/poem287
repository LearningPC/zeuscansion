And the ancient Arrowmaker
Turned again unto his labor
Sat down by his sunny doorway
Murmuring to himself and saying
Thus it is our daughters leave us
Those we love and those who love us
Just when they have learned to help us
When we are old and lean upon them
Comes a youth with flaunting feathers
With his flute of reeds a stranger
Wanders piping through the village
Beckons to the fairest maiden
And she follows where he leads her
Leaving all things for the stranger
