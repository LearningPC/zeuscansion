By the shore of Gitche Gumee
By the shining BigSeaWater
At the doorway of his wigwam
In the pleasant Summer morning
Hiawatha stood and waited
All the air was full of freshness
All the earth was bright and joyous
And before him through the sunshine
Westward toward the neighboring forest
Passed in golden swarms the Ahmo
Passed the bees the honeymakers
Burning singing in the sunshine
