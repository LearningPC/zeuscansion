On the next day of his fasting
By the rivers brink he wandered
Through the Muskoday the meadow
Saw the wild rice Mahnomonee
Saw the blueberry Meenahga
And the strawberry Odahmin
And the gooseberry Shahbomin
And the grapevine the Bemahgut
Trailing oer the alderbranches
Filling all the air with fragrance
Master of Life he cried desponding
Must our lives depend on these things
