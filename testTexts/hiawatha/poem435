Then the Medicinemen the Medas
The magicians the Wabenos
And the Jossakeeds the Prophets
Came to visit Hiawatha
Built a Sacred Lodge beside him
To appease him to console him
Walked in silent grave procession
Bearing each a pouch of healing
Skin of beaver lynx or otter
Filled with magic roots and simples
Filled with very potent medicines
