So they sat and played together
All the old men and the young men
Played for dresses weapons wampum
Played till midnight played till morning
Played until the Yenadizze
Till the cunning PauPukKeewis
Of their treasures had despoiled them
Of the best of all their dresses
Shirts of deerskin robes of ermine
Belts of wampum crests of feathers
Warlike weapons pipes and pouches
Twenty eyes glared wildly at him
Like the eyes of wolves glared at him
