In the thickets and the meadows
Piped the bluebird the Owaissa
On the summit of the lodges
Sang the robin the Opechee
In the covert of the pinetrees
Cooed the pigeon the Omemee
And the sorrowing Hiawatha
Speechless in his infinite sorrow
Heard their voices calling to him
Went forth from his gloomy doorway
Stood and gazed into the heaven
Gazed upon the earth and waters
