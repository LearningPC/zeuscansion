Shawondasee fat and lazy
Had his dwelling far to southward
In the drowsy dreamy sunshine
In the neverending Summer
He it was who sent the woodbirds
Sent the robin the Opechee
Sent the bluebird the Owaissa
Sent the Shawshaw sent the swallow
Sent the wildgoose Wawa northward
Sent the melons and tobacco
And the grapes in purple clusters
