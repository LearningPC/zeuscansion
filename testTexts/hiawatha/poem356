Round and round they wheeled and darted
Filled the Evening Star with music
With their songs of joy and freedom
Filled the Evening Star with splendor
With the fluttering of their plumage
Till the boy the little hunter
Bent his bow and shot an arrow
Shot a swift and fatal arrow
And a bird with shining feathers
At his feet fell wounded sorely
