Till at length a small green feather
From the earth shot slowly upward
Then another and another
And before the Summer ended
Stood the maize in all its beauty
With its shining robes about it
And its long soft yellow tresses
And in rapture Hiawatha
Cried aloud It is Mondamin
Yes the friend of man Mondamin
