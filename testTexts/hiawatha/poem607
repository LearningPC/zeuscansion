I beheld too in that vision
All the secrets of the future
Of the distant days that shall be
I beheld the westward marches
Of the unknown crowded nations
All the land was full of people
Restless struggling toiling striving
Speaking many tongues yet feeling
But one heartbeat in their bosoms
In the woodlands rang their axes
Smoked their towns in all the valleys
Over all the lakes and rivers
Rushed their great canoes of thunder
