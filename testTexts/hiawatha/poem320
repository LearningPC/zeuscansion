Thus the gentle Chibiabos
Sang his song of love and longing
And Iagoo the great boaster
He the marvellous storyteller
He the friend of old Nokomis
Jealous of the sweet musician
Jealous of the applause they gave him
Saw in all the eyes around him
Saw in all their looks and gestures
That the wedding guests assembled
Longed to hear his pleasant stories
His immeasurable falsehoods
