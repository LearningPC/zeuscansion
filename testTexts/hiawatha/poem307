Then along the sandy margin
Of the lake the BigSeaWater
On he sped with frenzied gestures
Stamped upon the sand and tossed it
Wildly in the air around him
Till the wind became a whirlwind
Till the sand was blown and sifted
Like great snowdrifts oer the landscape
Heaping all the shores with Sand Dunes
Sand Hills of the Nagow Wudjoo
