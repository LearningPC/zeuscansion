Then he smiled and said Tomorrow
Is the last day of your conflict
Is the last day of your fasting
You will conquer and oercome me
Make a bed for me to lie in
Where the rain may fall upon me
Where the sun may come and warm me
Strip these garments green and yellow
Strip this nodding plumage from me
Lay me in the earth and make it
Soft and loose and light above me
