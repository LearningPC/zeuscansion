Then upon one knee uprising
Hiawatha aimed an arrow
Scarce a twig moved with his motion
Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled
But the wary roebuck started
Stamped with all his hoofs together
Listened with one foot uplifted
Leaped as if to meet the arrow
Ah the singing fatal arrow
Like a wasp it buzzed and stung him
