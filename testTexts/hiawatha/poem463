Said the lucky PauPukKeewis
In my wigwam I am lonely
In my wanderings and adventures
I have need of a companion
Fain would have a Meshinauwa
An attendant and pipebearer
I will venture all these winnings
All these garments heaped about me
All this wampum all these feathers
On a single throw will venture
All against the young man yonder
T was a youth of sixteen summers
T was a nephew of Iagoo
FaceinaMist the people called him
