Ye who love the haunts of Nature
Love the sunshine of the meadow
Love the shadow of the forest
Love the wind among the branches
And the rainshower and the snowstorm
And the rushing of great rivers
Through their palisades of pinetrees
And the thunder in the mountains
Whose innumerable echoes
Flap like eagles in their eyries
Listen to these wild traditions
To this Song of Hiawatha
