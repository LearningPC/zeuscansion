Many things Nokomis taught him
Of the stars that shine in heaven
Showed him Ishkoodah the comet
Ishkoodah with fiery tresses
Showed the DeathDance of the spirits
Warriors with their plumes and warclubs
Flaring far away to northward
In the frosty nights of Winter
Showed the broad white road in heaven
Pathway of the ghosts the shadows
Running straight across the heavens
Crowded with the ghosts the shadows
