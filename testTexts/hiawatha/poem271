With his moccasins of magic
At each stride a mile he measured
Yet the way seemed long before him
And his heart outran his footsteps
And he journeyed without resting
Till he heard the cataracts laughter
Heard the Falls of Minnehaha
Calling to him through the silence
Pleasant is the sound he murmured
Pleasant is the voice that calls me
