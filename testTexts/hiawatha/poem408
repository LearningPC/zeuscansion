All these things did Hiawatha
Show unto his wondering people
And interpreted their meaning
And he said Behold your graveposts
Have no mark no sign nor symbol
Go and paint them all with figures
Each one with its household symbol
With its own ancestral Totem
So that those who follow after
May distinguish them and know them
