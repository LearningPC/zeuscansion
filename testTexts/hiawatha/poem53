Till at last he rose defeated
Could not bear the heat and laughter
Could not bear the merry singing
But rushed headlong through the doorway
Stamped upon the crusted snowdrifts
Stamped upon the lakes and rivers
Made the snow upon them harder
Made the ice upon them thicker
Challenged Shingebis the diver
To come forth and wrestle with him
To come forth and wrestle naked
On the frozen fens and moorlands
