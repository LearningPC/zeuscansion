Fiercely the red sun descending
Burned his way along the heavens
Set the sky on fire behind him
As warparties when retreating
Burn the prairies on their wartrail
And the moon the Nightsun eastward
Suddenly starting from his ambush
Followed fast those bloody footprints
Followed in that fiery wartrail
With its glare upon his features
