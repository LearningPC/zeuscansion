And they said Farewell forever
Said Farewell O Hiawatha
And the forests dark and lonely
Moved through all their depths of darkness
Sighed Farewell O Hiawatha
And the waves upon the margin
Rising rippling on the pebbles
Sobbed Farewell O Hiawatha
And the heron the Shuhshuhgah
From her haunts among the fenlands
Screamed Farewell O Hiawatha
