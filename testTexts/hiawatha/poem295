You shall hear how PauPukKeewis
How the handsome Yenadizze
Danced at Hiawathas wedding
How the gentle Chibiabos
He the sweetest of musicians
Sang his songs of love and longing
How Iagoo the great boaster
He the marvellous storyteller
Told his tales of strange adventure
That the feast might be more joyous
That the time might pass more gayly
And the guests be more contented
