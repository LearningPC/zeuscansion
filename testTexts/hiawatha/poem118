Thus was fought that famous battle
In the dreadful days of Shahshah
In the days long since departed
In the kingdom of the WestWind
Still the hunter sees its traces
Scattered far oer hill and valley
Sees the giant bulrush growing
By the ponds and watercourses
Sees the masses of the Wawbeek
Lying still in every valley
