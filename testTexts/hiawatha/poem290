All the travelling winds went with them
Oer the meadows through the forest
All the stars of night looked at them
Watched with sleepless eyes their slumber
From his ambush in the oaktree
Peeped the squirrel Adjidaumo
Watched with eager eyes the lovers
And the rabbit the Wabasso
Scampered from the path before them
Peering peeping from his burrow
Sat erect upon his haunches
Watched with curious eyes the lovers
