Homeward now came Hiawatha
From his hunting in the forest
With the snow upon his tresses
And the red deer on his shoulders
At the feet of Laughing Water
Down he threw his lifeless burden
Nobler handsomer she thought him
Than when first he came to woo her
First threw down the deer before her
As a token of his wishes
As a promise of the future
