And he cried O Mudjekeewis
It was you who killed Wenonah
Took her young life and her beauty
Broke the Lily of the Prairie
Trampled it beneath your footsteps
You confess it you confess it
And the mighty Mudjekeewis
Tossed upon the wind his tresses
Bowed his hoary head in anguish
With a silent nod assented
