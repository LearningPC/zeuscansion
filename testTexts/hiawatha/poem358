When her blood fell on the planet
On the sacred Star of Evening
Broken was the spell of magic
Powerless was the strange enchantment
And the youth the fearless bowman
Suddenly felt himself descending
Held by unseen hands but sinking
Downward through the empty spaces
Downward through the clouds and vapors
Till he rested on an island
On an island green and grassy
Yonder in the BigSeaWater
