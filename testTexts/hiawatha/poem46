But the fierce Kabibonokka
Had his dwelling among icebergs
In the everlasting snowdrifts
In the kingdom of Wabasso
In the land of the White Rabbit
He it was whose hand in Autumn
Painted all the trees with scarlet
Stained the leaves with red and yellow
He it was who sent the snowflake
Sifting hissing through the forest
Froze the ponds the lakes the rivers
Drove the loon and seagull southward
Drove the cormorant and curlew
To their nests of sedge and seatang
In the realms of Shawondasee
