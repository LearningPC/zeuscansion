Many a daylight dawned and darkened
Many a night shook off the daylight
As the pine shakes off the snowflakes
From the midnight of its branches
Day by day the guests unmoving
Sat there silent in the wigwam
But by night in storm or starlight
Forth they went into the forest
Bringing firewood to the wigwam
Bringing pinecones for the burning
Always sad and always silent
