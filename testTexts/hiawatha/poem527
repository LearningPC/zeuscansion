So they gathered cones together
Gathered seedcones of the pinetree
Gathered blue cones of the firtree
In the woods by Taquamenaw
Brought them to the rivers margin
Heaped them in great piles together
Where the red rocks from the margin
Jutting overhang the river
There they lay in wait for Kwasind
The malicious Little People
