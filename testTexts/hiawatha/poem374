All around the happy village
Stood the maizefields green and shining
Waved the green plumes of Mondamin
Waved his soft and sunny tresses
Filling all the land with plenty
T was the women who in Springtime
Planted the broad fields and fruitful
Buried in the earth Mondamin
T was the women who in Autumn
Stripped the yellow husks of harvest
Stripped the garments from Mondamin
Even as Hiawatha taught them
