To a lake with many islands
Came the breathless PauPukKeewis
Where among the waterlilies
Pishnekuh the brant were sailing
Through the tufts of rushes floating
Steering through the reedy Islands
Now their broad black beaks they lifted
Now they plunged beneath the water
Now they darkened in the shadow
Now they brightened in the sunshine
