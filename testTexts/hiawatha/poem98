So he journeyed westward westward
Left the fleetest deer behind him
Left the antelope and bison
Crossed the rushing Esconaba
Crossed the mighty Mississippi
Passed the Mountains of the Prairie
Passed the land of Crows and Foxes
Passed the dwellings of the Blackfeet
Came unto the Rocky Mountains
To the kingdom of the WestWind
Where upon the gusty summits
Sat the ancient Mudjekeewis
Ruler of the winds of heaven
