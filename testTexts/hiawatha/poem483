Over rock and over river
Through bush and brake and forest
Ran the cunning PauPukKeewis
Like an antelope he bounded
Till he came unto a streamlet
In the middle of the forest
To a streamlet still and tranquil
That had overflowed its margin
To a dam made by the beavers
To a pond of quiet water
Where kneedeep the trees were standing
Where the water lilies floated
Where the rushes waved and whispered
