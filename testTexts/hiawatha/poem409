And they painted on the graveposts
On the graves yet unforgotten
Each his own ancestral Totem
Each the symbol of his household
Figures of the Bear and Reindeer
Of the Turtle Crane and Beaver
Each inverted as a token
That the owner was departed
That the chief who bore the symbol
Lay beneath in dust and ashes
