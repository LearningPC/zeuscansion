Silent was it and deserted
No one met him at the doorway
No one came to bid him welcome
But the birds were singing round it
In and out and round the doorway
Hopping singing fluttering feeding
And aloft upon the ridgepole
Kahgahgee the King of Ravens
Sat with fiery eyes and screaming
Flapped his wings at PauPukKeewis
