Winged with feathers tipped with jasper
Swift flew Hiawathas arrow
Just as Megissogwon stooping
Raised a heavy stone to throw it
Full upon the crown it struck him
At the roots of his long tresses
And he reeled and staggered forward
Plunging like a wounded bison
Yes like Pezhekee the bison
When the snow is on the prairie
