Then the lodge began to tremble
Straight began to shake and tremble
And they felt it rising rising
Slowly through the air ascending
From the darkness of the treetops
Forth into the dewy starlight
Till it passed the topmost branches
And behold the wooden dishes
All were changed to shells of scarlet
And behold the earthen kettles
All were changed to bowls of silver
And the roofpoles of the wigwam
Were as glittering rods of silver
And the roof of bark upon them
As the shining shards of beetles
