Straight he took his bow of ashtree
On the sand one end he rested
With his knee he pressed the middle
Stretched the faithful bowstring tighter
Took an arrow jasperheaded
Shot it at the Shining Wigwam
Sent it singing as a herald
As a bearer of his message
Of his challenge loud and lofty
Come forth from your lodge PearlFeather
Hiawatha waits your coming
