Swift of foot was Hiawatha
He could shoot an arrow from him
And run forward with such fleetness
That the arrow fell behind him
Strong of arm was Hiawatha
He could shoot ten arrows upward
Shoot them with such strength and swiftness
That the tenth had left the bowstring
Ere the first to earth had fallen
