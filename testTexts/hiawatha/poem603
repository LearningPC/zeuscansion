In it said he came a people
In the great canoe with pinions
Came he said a hundred warriors
Painted white were all their faces
And with hair their chins were covered
And the warriors and the women
Laughed and shouted in derision
Like the ravens on the treetops
Like the crows upon the hemlocks
Kaw they said what lies you tell us
Do not think that we believe them
