All night long he sailed upon it
Sailed upon that sluggish water
Covered with its mould of ages
Black with rotting waterrushes
Rank with flags and leaves of lilies
Stagnant lifeless dreary dismal
Lighted by the shimmering moonlight
And by willothewisps illumined
Fires by ghosts of dead men kindled
In their weary nightencampments
