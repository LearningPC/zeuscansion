Listless careless Shawondasee
In his life he had one shadow
In his heart one sorrow had he
Once as he was gazing northward
Far away upon a prairie
He beheld a maiden standing
Saw a tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie
Brightest green were all her garments
And her hair was like the sunshine
