With him dwelt his darkeyed daughter
Wayward as the Minnehaha
With her moods of shade and sunshine
Eyes that smiled and frowned alternate
Feet as rapid as the river
Tresses flowing like the water
And as musical a laughter
And he named her from the river
From the waterfall he named her
Minnehaha Laughing Water
