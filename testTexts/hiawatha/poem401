Face to face we speak together
But we cannot speak when absent
Cannot send our voices from us
To the friends that dwell afar off
Cannot send a secret message
But the bearer learns our secret
May pervert it may betray it
May reveal it unto others
Thus said Hiawatha walking
In the solitary forest
Pondering musing in the forest
On the welfare of his people
