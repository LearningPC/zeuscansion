There he lay in all his armor
On each side a shield to guard him
Plates of bone upon his forehead
Down his sides and back and shoulders
Plates of bone with spines projecting
Painted was he with his warpaints
Stripes of yellow red and azure
Spots of brown and spots of sable
And he lay there on the bottom
Fanning with his fins of purple
As above him Hiawatha
In his birch canoe came sailing
With his fishingline of cedar
