But the wary Hiawatha
Saw the figure ere it vanished
Saw the form of PauPukKeewis
Glide into the soft blue shadow
Of the pinetrees of the forest
Toward the squares of white beyond it
Toward an opening in the forest
Like a wind it rushed and panted
Bending all the boughs before it
And behind it as the rain comes
Came the steps of Hiawatha
