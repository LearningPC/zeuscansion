On the outskirts of the forests
Twixt the shadow and the sunshine
Herds of fallow deer were feeding
But they saw not Hiawatha
To his bow he whispered Fail not
To his arrow whispered Swerve not
Sent it singing on its errand
To the red heart of the roebuck
Threw the deer across his shoulder
And sped forward without pausing
