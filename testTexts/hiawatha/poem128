On the first day of his fasting
Through the leafy woods he wandered
Saw the deer start from the thicket
Saw the rabbit in his burrow
Heard the pheasant Bena drumming
Heard the squirrel Adjidaumo
Rattling in his hoard of acorns
Saw the pigeon the Omeme
Building nests among the pinetrees
And in flocks the wildgoose Wawa
Flying to the fenlands northward
Whirring wailing far above him
Master of Life he cried desponding
Must our lives depend on these things
