Then uprose the Laughing Water
From the ground fair Minnehaha
Laid aside her mat unfinished
Brought forth food and set before them
Water brought them from the brooklet
Gave them food in earthen vessels
Gave them drink in bowls of basswood
Listened while the guest was speaking
Listened while her father answered
But not once her lips she opened
Not a single word she uttered
