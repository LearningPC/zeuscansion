Then in swift pursuit departed
Hiawatha and the hunters
On the trail of PauPukKeewis
Through the forest where he passed it
To the headlands where he rested
But they found not PauPukKeewis
Only in the trampled grasses
In the whortleberrybushes
Found the couch where he had rested
Found the impress of his body
