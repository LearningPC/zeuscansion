First he danced a solemn measure
Very slow in step and gesture
In and out among the pinetrees
Through the shadows and the sunshine
Treading softly like a panther
Then more swiftly and still swifter
Whirling spinning round in circles
Leaping oer the guests assembled
Eddying round and round the wigwam
Till the leaves went whirling with him
Till the dust and wind together
Swept in eddies round about him
