Straight between them ran the pathway
Never grew the grass upon it
Singing birds that utter falsehoods
Storytellers mischiefmakers
Found no eager ear to listen
Could not breed illwill between them
For they kept each others counsel
Spake with naked hearts together
Pondering much and much contriving
How the tribes of men might prosper
