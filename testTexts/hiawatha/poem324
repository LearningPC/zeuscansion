He it was who carved the cradle
Of the little Hiawatha
Carved its framework out of linden
Bound it strong with reindeer sinews
He it was who taught him later
How to make his bows and arrows
How to make the bows of ashtree
And the arrows of the oaktree
So among the guests assembled
At my Hiawathas wedding
Sat Iagoo old and ugly
Sat the marvellous storyteller
