Slowly upward wavering gleaming
Rose the Ugudwash the sunfish
Seized the line of Hiawatha
Swung with all his weight upon it
Made a whirlpool in the water
Whirled the birch canoe in circles
Round and round in gurgling eddies
Till the circles in the water
Reached the faroff sandy beaches
Till the waterflags and rushes
Nodded on the distant margins
