And he wooed her with caresses
Wooed her with his smile of sunshine
With his flattering words he wooed her
With his sighing and his singing
Gentlest whispers in the branches
Softest music sweetest odors
Till he drew her to his bosom
Folded in his robes of crimson
Till into a star he changed her
Trembling still upon his bosom
And forever in the heavens
They are seen together walking
Wabun and the WabunAnnung
Wabun and the Star of Morning
