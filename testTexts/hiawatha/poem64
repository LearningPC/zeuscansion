She was sporting with her women
Swinging in a swing of grapevines
When her rival the rejected
Full of jealousy and hatred
Cut the leafy swing asunder
Cut in twain the twisted grapevines
And Nokomis fell affrighted
Downward through the evening twilight
On the Muskoday the meadow
On the prairie full of blossoms
See a star falls said the people
From the sky a star is falling
