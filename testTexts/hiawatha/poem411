The Great Spirit the Creator
Flashing light through all the heaven
The Great Serpent the Kenabeek
With his bloody crest erected
Creeping looking into heaven
In the sky the sun that listens
And the moon eclipsed and dying
Owl and eagle crane and henhawk
And the cormorant bird of magic
Headless men that walk the heavens
Bodies lying pierced with arrows
Bloody hands of death uplifted
Flags on graves and great warcaptains
Grasping both the earth and heaven
