All in vain did PauPukKeewis
Struggle to regain his balance
Whirling round and round and downward
He beheld in turn the village
And in turn the flock above him
Saw the village coming nearer
And the flock receding farther
Heard the voices growing louder
Heard the shouting and the laughter
Saw no more the flocks above him
Only saw the earth beneath him
Dead out of the empty heaven
Dead among the shouting people
With a heavy sound and sullen
Fell the brant with broken pinions
