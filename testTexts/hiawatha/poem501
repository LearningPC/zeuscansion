And it fluttered strove and struggled
Waving hither waving thither
As the curtains of a wigwam
Struggle with their thongs of deerskin
When the wintry wind is blowing
Till it drew itself together
Till it rose up from the body
Till it took the form and features
Of the cunning PauPukKeewis
Vanishing into the forest
